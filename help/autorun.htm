<h1>Automatic Running</h1>
When it comes time to distribute your game, you can package up the interpreter with your game
into an archive or installer. But if you want the user to be able to start your game just by
clicking on an icon, you can rename <b>Git.exe</b> to the same as the name as your game's
Glulx file (apart from the <b>.exe</b> file extension). When the interpreter starts up it
first looks for a Blorb file with the same name as the executable, and if one is found, loads
and runs it straight away. So, if your game file is <b>Foo.blb</b> and the renamed interpreter
executable is <b>Foo.exe</b>, all the user needs to do to run your game is double click on
<b>Foo.exe</b>.
