<h1>Revision History</h1>

<b>Git 1.3.0 (Windows Glk 1.43)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.3.0, which fixes a bug related to Glk call dispatching,
and a bug in the file restore logic.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.9 (Windows Glk 1.43)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.3, which includes more control when playing sounds.
This revision of the Glk specification also now specifies the meaning of the volume argument to
sound related Glk calls: as a result the handling of the volume has been changed to match the
specification.
<li>[More] prompts now function even if the game has exited, allowing any
long amount of final text to be read.
<li>Fixed a bug with file streams when reading and writing to the same file.
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.9, which fixes bugs related to Glk call dispatching,
following similar fixes in Glulxe.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.8 (Windows Glk 1.42)</b>
<ul>
<li>The accuracy of the time returned by glk_current_time() has been improved. Providing that the
computer supports a sufficiently high resolution timer, the returned time is now correct to the
nearest microsecond.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.8 (Windows Glk 1.41)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.2, which includes functions for accessing the system's date and time.
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.1, which includes functions for Unicode string decomposition and
normalization, and control over line input echoing and terminator characters.
<li>Unicode characters now appear correctly in the scrollback dialog, provided that the dialog
font supports them.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.8 (Windows Glk 1.40)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.8, which fixes a few obscure bugs.
<li>Corrected problems with formatting and line input when margin images are present.
<li>Corrected a mistake in the handling of alpha-blended images.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.7 (Windows Glk 1.39)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.7, which implements the Glulx 3.1.2 specification (for floating point opcodes).
<li>The window can be made to fill the entire screen; press <b>Alt+Enter</b> to toggle
this full screen mode on and off.
<li>A new configuration file option, "FullScreen", also makes the window fill the entire screen.
<li>During line input, Ctrl+Left moves the cursor to the start of the current word, and Ctrl+Right
moves to the end.
<li>The logic when scaling alpha-blended images has been improved, so there should no longer be
artifacts round the edges of such images.
<li>Data being written to files is now flushed whenever input is requested from the user.
This allows, for example, transcript files to update as a game is being played, and not only
when the interpreter closes the file.
<li>Corrected a problem which could result in the options dialog using the wrong font.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.6 (Windows Glk 1.38)</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a file creation bug in glk_stream_open_file().
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.6 (Windows Glk 1.37)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.6, which fixes a bug in retained Glk array handling.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.5 (Windows Glk 1.37)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.5, which fixes several problems shown by Andrew Plotkin's
glulxercise test cases.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.4 (Windows Glk 1.37)</b>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on a Glk window now only shifts the keyboard input focus to that window if the
window is capable of text input: this means that after clicking on a graphics window, text can
still be input in a text buffer window without having to click back to the text buffer window.
<li>The implementation of the algorithm for scaling images has been sped up again.
</ul>
