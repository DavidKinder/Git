<h1>Revision History</h1>

<b>Git 1.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.47)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.5, which adds character input to graphics windows, clarifies
the behaviour of zero-size windows, and specifies the encoding of Unicode text files as UTF-8.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.46)</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug when the streamnum opcode is called with the smallest possible negative number.
<li>A new configuration file option, "FontFile", allows the game's font to be loaded from
a font file in the same directory as the game.
<li>Some of the Unicode characters above $FFFF (that is, those in the Supplementary Multilingual
Plane) can now be output, provided that an appropriate font is available.
<li>Unicode text files are now encoded as UTF-8, as specified in the latest draft of the Glk
0.7.5 specification.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.3.4 (Windows Glk 1.45)</b>
<ul>
<li>Performance improvements from Peter De Wachter, which give approximately a 15% speed
increase.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.3.3 (Windows Glk 1.45)</b>
<ul>
<li>The way in which colours are specified in the options dialog has been simplified: the
"General" tab now contains three buttons that allow the overall text, background and hyperlink
colours to be specified. Text and background colours are no longer specified in the "Styles"
tab on a per-style basis.
<li>The function glk_window_get_arrangement() no longer causes a crash if any of its output
arguments are 0.
<li>Added acceleration functions 8 through 13, which work correctly when the Inform 6 compiler
setting NUM_ATTR_BYTES is changed, contributed by Andrew Plotkin.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.3.2 (Windows Glk 1.44)</b>
<ul>
<li>A further fix related to Glk call dispatching, following the similar fix added to
Glulxe 0.5.1.
<li>Increased the undo buffer size to 2Mb.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.3.1 (Windows Glk 1.44)</b>
<ul>
<li>Further fixes related to Glk call dispatching, following similar fixes added to
Glulxe 0.5.0.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.3.0 (Windows Glk 1.44)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.3.0, which fixes a bug related to Glk call dispatching,
and a bug in the file restore logic.
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.4, which introduces resource streams (i.e. access to
read-only data held in the Blorb game file).
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.9 (Windows Glk 1.43)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.3, which includes more control when playing sounds.
This revision of the Glk specification also now specifies the meaning of the volume argument to
sound related Glk calls: as a result the handling of the volume has been changed to match the
specification.
<li>[More] prompts now function even if the game has exited, allowing any
long amount of final text to be read.
<li>Fixed a bug with file streams when reading and writing to the same file.
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.9, which fixes bugs related to Glk call dispatching,
following similar fixes in Glulxe.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.8 (Windows Glk 1.42)</b>
<ul>
<li>The accuracy of the time returned by glk_current_time() has been improved. Providing that the
computer supports a sufficiently high resolution timer, the returned time is now correct to the
nearest microsecond.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.8 (Windows Glk 1.41)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.2, which includes functions for accessing the system's date and time.
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.1, which includes functions for Unicode string decomposition and
normalization, and control over line input echoing and terminator characters.
<li>Unicode characters now appear correctly in the scrollback dialog, provided that the dialog
font supports them.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.8 (Windows Glk 1.40)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.8, which fixes a few obscure bugs.
<li>Corrected problems with formatting and line input when margin images are present.
<li>Corrected a mistake in the handling of alpha-blended images.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.7 (Windows Glk 1.39)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.7, which implements the Glulx 3.1.2 specification (for floating point opcodes).
<li>The window can be made to fill the entire screen; press <b>Alt+Enter</b> to toggle
this full screen mode on and off.
<li>A new configuration file option, "FullScreen", also makes the window fill the entire screen.
<li>During line input, Ctrl+Left moves the cursor to the start of the current word, and Ctrl+Right
moves to the end.
<li>The logic when scaling alpha-blended images has been improved, so there should no longer be
artifacts round the edges of such images.
<li>Data being written to files is now flushed whenever input is requested from the user.
This allows, for example, transcript files to update as a game is being played, and not only
when the interpreter closes the file.
<li>Corrected a problem which could result in the options dialog using the wrong font.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.6 (Windows Glk 1.38)</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a file creation bug in glk_stream_open_file().
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.6 (Windows Glk 1.37)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.6, which fixes a bug in retained Glk array handling.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.5 (Windows Glk 1.37)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Git 1.2.5, which fixes several problems shown by Andrew Plotkin's
glulxercise test cases.
</ul>

<b>Git 1.2.4 (Windows Glk 1.37)</b>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on a Glk window now only shifts the keyboard input focus to that window if the
window is capable of text input: this means that after clicking on a graphics window, text can
still be input in a text buffer window without having to click back to the text buffer window.
<li>The implementation of the algorithm for scaling images has been sped up again.
</ul>
