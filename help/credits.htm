<b>Git Credits</b>
<p>
Iain's text file with the Git source code includes the following credits:
<p>
Andrew Plotkin invented Glulx, so obviously Git wouldn't exist without him. I
also reused some code from his Glulxe interpreter (glkop.c and search.c), which
saved me a lot of time and let me concentrate on the more interesting stuff.
<p>
Many thanks are due to John Cater, who not only persuaded me to use source
control, but let me use his own CVS server. John also provided lots of useful
advice and encouragement, as did Sean Barrett.
<p>
Thanks also to Joe Mason, Adam Thornton, Simon Baldwin and Joonas Pihlaja who
were among the first to try it out and complain that it wasn't working. Joonas
also gets special brownie points for trying out more bizarre boundary cases than
I realised existed in the first place.
<p>
Tor Andersson was apparently the first person to use setmemsize, since he also
explained why it didn't work and contributed a fix. Thanks, Tor!
<p>
David Kinder has done a stellar job of maintaining the code recently. Thanks
also to Eliuk Blau for tracking down bugs in the memory management opcodes.
<p>
