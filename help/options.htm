<h1>Changing Options</h1>
From the Options dialog, you can change the various display options of Windows Git.
<p>
<h2>General Options</h2>
<p>
<b>Borders between windows</b><br>
If selected, windows that the game opens in the main interpreter window are surrounded by a standard
window border.
<p>
<b>Enable menus, toolbars and the status bar</b><br>
If selected, the interpreter window has a menu bar, a toolbar and a status bar. If not selected, these
items are not present. In either case, the options dialog is still always accessible from the system
menu (that is, the menu obtained by clicking on the icon in the left corner of the interpreter's title bar).
<p>
<b>Style hints override user settings</b><br>
If selected, style hints set by the game override any style options selected by the user. The style
options are described below.
<p>
<b>Use a custom hyperlink colour</b><br>
If selected, hyperlinks are displayed using the colour set by the colour chooser button to the right of
this option.
<p>
<b>Underline hyperlinks</b><br>
If selected, hyperlinks are displayed underlined, as in most web browsers.
<p>
<b>If the game has an iFiction record ...</b><br>
When Windows Git loads a game that contains an iFiction record, it may show the <b>About This Game</b>
dialog. This option determines whether the dialog is never shown, only shown the first time, or shown
every time.
<p>
<h2>Style Options</h2>
Note that changing the values discussed below will only affect new windows opened by the game, not any
existing ones. Furthermore, if the game overrides any of these settings with style hints, then that
particular style will not be editable.
<p>
<b>Window</b><br>
Determines the type of window for which the style is being edited. Text buffer windows are the normal
windows in which output appears in the proportional font and the user enters input. Text grid windows
always show text in a fixed width font and are used for tasks such as a status bar. Only some of the
style options are relevant for text grid windows; the remainder are greyed out.
<p>
<b>Style</b><br>
Determines the particular style being edited.
<p>
<b>Indentation</b><br>
How much a paragraph in this style is indented, in arbitrary units.
<p>
<b>Paragraph Indentation</b><br>
How much the first line of a paragraph in this style is indented, in arbitrary units.
<p>
<b>Justification</b><br>
Whether paragraphs are drawn flush with the left margin, the right margin, both margins, or
centered.
<p>
<b>Text Size</b><br>
The size of the text, measured in arbitrary units, relative to the default size determined
by the user using the font dialogs from the menu or toolbar.
<p>
<b>Text Weight</b><br>
Whether the text is drawn normally, emphasized, or lightly.
<p>
<b>Italic</b><br>
If selected, text is drawn italicised.
<p>
<b>Proportional</b><br>
If selected, text is drawn using the proportional font. If not selected, the fixed-width
font is used instead.
<p>
<b>Reverse</b><br>
If selected, text is drawn reversed, i.e. the background colour is used to draw the text,
with the background set to the text colour.
<p>
<b>Text Colour</b><br>
The colour in which the text is drawn in.
<p>
<b>Background</b><br>
The colour in which the background behind the text is drawn.
<p>
<h2>Speech Options</h2>
Windows Git can use Microsoft's Speech Engine 5 to speak text, which is present by default
in Windows XP and later. If it is present, there is a <b>Speech</b> tab in in the options
dialog, containing controls that allow speaking of the game's text to be turned on, and the
voice and speed at which it is spoken in to be set.
